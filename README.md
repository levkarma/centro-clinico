## Centro Clinico, New Jersey

This site was created from scratch for a family clinic in New Jersey.

The site is statically built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) (Vue.js static site generator) and hosted for free on [netlify.com](https://netlify.com).

Features include no-lag navigation between pages due to SPA design and Spanish translations.

Instead of creating a CMS to post bulletin updates, the client's needs were satisfied by embedding their Twitter feed.

Design was loosely inspired by [https://www.onemedical.com/](https://www.onemedical.com/). Bulma is used as a CSS framework.
